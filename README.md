# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

->JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils

->JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries

->DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly

->Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices

->Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label


## How Do I Complete this Project?

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
